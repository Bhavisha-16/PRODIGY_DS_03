This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. Utilizing a dataset from Kaggle that contains tweets labeled with sentiment scores, we perform comprehensive sentiment analysis to derive meaningful insights. The key steps include data preprocessing, sentiment classification, and visualization of sentiment trends. This analysis aids in uncovering how public perception varies over time and in response to different events or actions by brands. The visualizations provide a clear and concise representation of sentiment dynamics, making it easier for stakeholders to make informed decisions.
