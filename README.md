The Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository contains data related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe (yes/no) to a term deposit (which can be considered as a purchase decision) based on various demographic, economic, and social factors. The dataset includes attributes such as age, job, marital status, education, housing loan status, and previous campaign outcomes. This project involves building a decision tree classifier to analyze these factors and predict customer purchase behavior, thereby aiding in campaign optimization and resource allocation for future marketing efforts.
